# Hacker News API Proxy

This Node.js application serves as a proxy for the Hacker News API, allowing users to retrieve details of the best stories based on their score. The API efficiently fetches information from Hacker News and responds with an array of top stories in descending order of score.

## Features

- **RESTful API:** Retrieve the details of the best `n` stories, where `n` is specified by the caller.
- **Logging:** Internal server logging captures incoming requests, responses sent, and error messages for better debugging and monitoring.
- **Scalable:** Designed to handle large numbers of requests without risking overloading the Hacker News API.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:3000/best-stories/:n, where `:n` is the number of stories to retrieve.

## Endpoints

- **GET /best-stories/:n:** Retrieve details of the best `n` stories.

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling to ensure smooth operation. It returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in case of issues.

## Logging

The application uses Winston and Morgan for logging. All incoming requests, responses sent, and error messages are logged for monitoring and debugging purposes.

## Dependencies

- Express: Web framework for Node.js
- Axios: HTTP client for making requests to the Hacker News API
- Winston: Logging library for Node.js
- Morgan: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js

## Possible Improvements

- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the number of requests to the Hacker News API.
- Add unit tests and improve test coverage for increased reliability.
- Enhance logging with more detailed information for advanced debugging.
- Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

## Assumptions

- The Hacker News API endpoints are assumed to be stable and accessible.
- The application assumes a reasonable rate limit for requests to the Hacker News API.
- It is assumed that the primary goal is to retrieve the best stories based on score.
